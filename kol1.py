#Banking simulator. Write a code in python that simulates the banking system. 
#The program should:
# - be able to create new banks
# - store client information in banks
# - allow for cash input and withdrawal
# - allow for money transfer from client to client
#If you can thing of any other features, you can add them.
#This code shoud be runnable with 'python kol1.py'.
#You don't need to use user input, just show me in the script that the structure of your code works.
#If you have spare time you can implement: Command Line Interface, some kind of data storage, or even multiprocessing.
#Do your best, show off with good, clean, well structured code - this is more important than number of features.
#After you finish, be sure to UPLOAD this (add, commit, push) to the remote repository.
#Good Luck
